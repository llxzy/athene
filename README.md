# Athene

### Why is it?

A simple tool to keep track of my reading habits. \
I needed something that is a bit better than manually inputting\
entries into a .txt file, but at the same time still is simple.

### What is it?

A C# program working alongside a SQLite database\
to display data in windows, courtesy of GTK.

### Why athene?

Development name that I'm too lazy to change.
